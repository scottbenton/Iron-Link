## Beta 0.2.0

### Features

- Added playsets, a new way to customize your game's rules. Hide moves, oracles, or assets you don't want to use.
- Added default playsets for Starforged + Sundered Isles for automatically showing & hiding the assets that are relevant to each.

### Changes

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where replacement moves (like `Repair` from Sundered Isles) were not properly overwriting their base moves.
